# Joe Reis Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains my project work and assignments from Joe Reis's Data Engineering Bootcamp. Here I document my learning journey and showcase the practical implementation of data engineering concepts.

## Course Overview

This bootcamp covers fundamental to advanced concepts in data engineering, including:

- Data pipeline development
- ETL/ELT processes
- Data warehouse design
- Data modeling
- Big data processing
- Cloud platforms and tools
- Best practices in data engineering
